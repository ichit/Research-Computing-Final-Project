## Scientific Question

Has the increase in aerosol emission in China affected the hydrology of the country?

## Hypothesis

Although aerosol emission increases albedo, I don't believe that the effect of just anthropogenic aerosols will cause a significant change within the precipitation of China. Unlike major volcanic eruptions, I do not think that anthropogenic aerosols will impact the climate to the same extent.

## Method

To answer my scientific question and test my hypothesis, I aim use a linear regression to understand the relationship between the two variables. I will create figures that will visualize the change in these variables over time and space. As well as time series figures and maps visualizing notable years.
